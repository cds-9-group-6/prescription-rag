# Structured Treatment Response Demo

This document demonstrates the new structured treatment response format that addresses your requirements for:
1. **Immediate treatment**
2. **Weekly treatment plan**
3. **Cohesive medicine recommendations**

## ðŸŽ¯ What's New

The system now returns structured JSON responses instead of plain text, providing organized treatment information that can be easily parsed and displayed in applications.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Start the API Server
```bash
./run_api.sh
```

### 2. Make a Structured Treatment Query
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8081/query/treatment" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "My tomato plants have dark spots and are wilting, what should I do?",
    "plant_type": "Tomato",
    "season": "Summer",
    "location": "Maharashtra"
  }'
```

### 3. Test the Endpoint
```bash
# Run comprehensive tests
./test_structured_treatment.py

# Quick test
./test_query_metrics.sh
```

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- Emergency measures for severe cases
- Specific timeline for implementation

### âœ… Weekly Treatment Plan  
- 4-week structured treatment schedule
- Specific actions for each week
- Monitoring guidelines for each phase

- **Secondary treatment**: Alternative/supportive medicine when needed
- **Organic alternatives**: Chemical-free options
- **Consolidated approach**: Avoids confusion from multiple medicine options

### âœ… Additional Benefits
- **Diagnosis information**: Disease identification and severity assessment
- **Prevention strategies**: Long-term disease management
- **Regional considerations**: Location-specific advice
- **Follow-up guidance**: When to seek additional help

## ðŸŽ¯ API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /query` | Basic text response (original format) |
| `POST /query/treatment` | **Structured JSON treatment response** |
| `POST /query/sources` | Response with source documents |
| `POST /query/metrics` | Response with performance metrics |

## ðŸ’¡ Benefits for Applications

1. **Easy Parsing**: JSON structure allows easy integration with mobile apps, web interfaces
2. **Consistent Format**: Always same structure regardless of disease/plant type  
3. **Progressive Treatment**: Clear week-by-week guidance
4. **Medicine Clarity**: Primary/secondary approach reduces confusion
5. **Actionable Steps**: Immediate vs. ongoing treatment clearly separated

## ðŸ“Š Testing Results

The system successfully parses agricultural knowledge from the ChromaDB and structures it into the required format, whether the information comes from:
- **KccAns**: Official agricultural advisory responses
- **LLM Knowledge**: When specific information isn't available in the database

This ensures consistent, structured treatment recommendations for farmers and agricultural applications.
