# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains notebooks for creating embeddings, building a vector database, and running RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using both **Groq API** and **Hugging Face**.  

---

## üìÇ Files in this Repository  

### 1. `Embedding_creation.ipynb`  
- Handles preprocessing of cleaned data.  
- Creates embeddings.  
- Inserts chunks into the vector database for retrieval.  

---

### 2. `Rag_with_groq.ipynb`  
- Runs the RAG pipeline using the **Groq API**.  
- Requires a **Groq API key**:  
  - You can create one by signing up at [Groq](https://groq.com).  
  - An existing API key is already placed in the **Amit** folder of the shared drive inside the `.env` file.  
- Requires the **`chroma_capstone_db_new`** vector database.  
- ‚úÖ To run this notebook:  
  1. Place the `.env` file in the same folder.  
  2. Ensure the vector database is available.  
  3. Execute the notebook cells.  

---

### 3. `Rag_huggingface.ipynb`  
- Similar to `Rag_with_groq.ipynb`.  
- Does **not** require a Groq API key.  
- Simply run the notebook to start the RAG pipeline.  

### 4. Running with Ollama on your system

- Two files have been created for running ollama with RAG:
    - The first is a fast-api app: rag_with_ollama_fastapi.py
    - The second is a normal Python file to be integrated into the agent flow: rag_with_ollama.py
- Two files are required, which support the running of the ollama RAG program files: The requirements.txt(Requirements file) and chroma_capstone_db_new (Vector database)
- Create a folder on your local desktop and place the four files under your folder. 
- Create a virtual environment using a Python version 3.10 or greater.
- Once virtual environment is created, cd into your virtual_environment_file/scripts and activate your virtual environment
- After activation, cd.. back into your local parent folder and run the command in your command prompt pip install -r requirements.txt
- Once all the packages are installed, you can now run both rag_with_ollama.py, rag_with_ollama_fastapi.py

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements  
- Python 3.10+  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
